    <h2>What makes a superhero?</h2>

    <p>
        A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a<br>
        superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess,</b> and you need to use<br>
        that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.<br>
        For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a<br>
        good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal<br>
        human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.<br>

        Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the Avengers, and the former CEO of Stark Industries.<br>
        A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist.<br>
        With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, Stark was one of the world's most powerful men following the deaths of his parents and enjoyed<br>
        the playboy lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan, while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles.<br>
        With his life on the line, Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape his captors. Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors to use against terrorists,<br>
        as well as Obadiah Stane who turned against Stark. Following his fight against Stane, Stark publicly revealed himself as Iron Man.<br>
